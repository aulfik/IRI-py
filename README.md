International Roughness Index (IRI) plot data

by Aulia Fikri

As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) writes on the [IRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_roughness_index)

> The international roughness index (IRI) is the roughness index most commonly obtained from measured longitudinal road profiles. It is calculated using a quarter-car vehicle math model, whose response is accumulated to yield a roughness index with units of slope (in/mi, m/km, etc.).

This work is temporary only to do the process of plotting the shapefile data step by step, so that it is easy to understand. Furthermore, this work will be continued by providing symbology and data calculation processes for determining road damage.

This work is not over yet. Currently, it is a collection of lecture notes in  Jupyter Notebook format using Python. These lecture notes relate to the computing courses in civil engineering and environmental engineering in my study.
